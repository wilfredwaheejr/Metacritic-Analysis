3422,Rick Ross,79.0,"July 20, 2010",3448,"Losing none of the momentum put in motion by his 2009 effort, Deeper Than Rap, Rick Ross keeps a very good thing going on Teflon Don, arguably his best album to date. You want rap-style luxury? Then Deeper is the better fit, but Teflon plays up the chilled and soulful elements of its predecessor, meaning Ross has graduated to a level where words like â€œorganicâ€ and â€œpoignantâ€ come into play. The former is best represented by â€œMayback Music IIIâ€ and itâ€™s swirling, â€˜70s-flavored dreamscape created by the J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League production team. Ross allows guests T.I. and Jadakiss to go first on the cut, then grabs his cigar for an uplifting story of ghetto triumph that goes from pushing to pleasing the folks (â€œParents never had a good job/Now itâ€™s black American Express cards""). When it comes to â€œpoignant,â€ the evidence is dotted throughout the album with the rapper reflecting on where heâ€™s been, and he often questions his own lust for fame. He chants the title to the opening â€œIâ€™m Not a Starâ€ as if it was a remindful mantra, but itâ€™s his new love of contrasts thatâ€™s really interesting, following Kanyeâ€™s swaggering on â€œLive Fast, Die Youngâ€ with â€œSeems to me we gettinâ€™ money for the wrong things/Look around, Maseratis for the whole team/Look at Haiti, children dyinâ€™ round the clock/Iâ€™d send a hundred grand but thatâ€™s a decent watchâ€. The familiar party and thugging tunes work too with â€œB.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast),â€ â€œNo. 1,â€ and the mixtape favorite â€œMC Hammerâ€ -- now with added Gucci Mane verse -- all coming correct. Add all the Illuminati references in the Jay-Z team-up (â€œFree Masonâ€), a decent smoking song (â€œSuper Highâ€), and a track where Cee-Loâ€™s performance just might make you misty (â€œTears of Joyâ€), and itâ€™s obvious Rossâ€™ albums are no longer just vessels for his singles. ~ David Jeffries",Teflon Don,70.0,73.6,6695.5

Their first full-length sees them fully morphed into a sophisticated indie pop group. Perch Patchwork is a bold debut, filled with bombastic arrangements, twisting modal progressions, and percussive layers. The skill set is high, but itâ€™s far less showy. Guitarists will still be enthralled by Dave Davidson's and Erin Elders' fingertapping, but acoustics take precedent, and moderately slow tempos maintain the album's balladic feel. If Trees, Swallows, Houses felt like a cousin to Don Cab or Hella, their first Barsuk outing has adapted the organic spirit of their Northwestern labelmates (particularly that of Menomena, the Long Winters, and John Vanderslice.) Of course, with Maps & Atlases' virtuosic chops and syncopated leanings, they kind of resemble BLK JKS or Minus the Bear, albeit with a Jethro Tull influence. Trendy South African rhythms and austere strings spin a web around Davidsonâ€™s poetic lyrics, and in this intricate, introspective setting, their talent becomes very clear. ~ Jason Lymangrover",Perch Patchwork,76.0,73.6,6695.5

9827,School of Seven Bells,69.0,"July 13, 2010",9958,"On their second album, School of Seven Bells cast themselves as an update of a specific kind of misfit band. Alpinisms reconstituted late-â€™80/early-â€˜90s shoegaze. Disconnect from Desire, however, updates the sound of a kind of band that would have opened for Peter Gabriel and Eurythmics, or headlined over Revolver, rather than tour with the likes of Lush, Ride, and Pale Saints. Here, a focused songcraft and central placement of the Deheza twinsâ€™ alluring vocals -- which tend to be lower and more earthly than they were on the debut -- disallow School of Seven Bells from being squarely shoegaze. At the same time, the band is too left of center, too odd, to be considered anywhere near the mainstream. Their cleaner, less wispy, more muscular sound, combined with more traditional songwriting, is not that radical a change. Itâ€™s closer to a slight shift that registers after a couple spins, once it becomes apparent that deeply emotive and relatively sparse songs like â€œI L U,â€ â€œJoviann,â€ and â€œThe Waitâ€ would have made excellent tracks buried throughout Sireâ€™s Just Say series. They have shoegaze lyric-generator staples like wind, waves, ocean, storms, and even talk of â€œslipping away.â€ And yet, the words are not merely functional, written solely for the sake of complementing the sound as an additional instrument. Theyâ€™re either poetically vague or vaguely poetic -- stuff like â€œLet me will the dial to turn and gild the air with silver pearls of rainâ€ and â€œWhenâ€™s the wait a cradle in which youâ€™re lulled from time to time, soundly spun into an insensate lie.â€ The thicker, more driving songs resemble a polished, warm Curve, whipping up squalls of noise over robust played-and-programmed rhythms that soar more often than batter. No matter the amount of layering, not a single element is obscured. This vivid directness suits them very well. ~ Andy Kellman",Disconnect from Desire,74.0,72.0,7269.0
